<p>
<strong>tabletrim.js</strong> is a jQuery/Javascript plugin which solves the problem of how to make large data tables responsive and usable on small screens.  The plugin collapses extraneous columns into a two column layout.  The first column is a sticky column which can be configured.  The sticky column is always visible.  The second column displays one of the other columns initially (also configurable) and provides a dropdown list for the other fields.  Selecting a new column in the dropdown will switch the content of the second column to the selected column.
</p>


<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<strong>tabletrim.js</strong> requires jQuery 1.7+ to run.</p>


<h2>HTML structure</h2>
<p>
<strong>tabletrim.js</strong> constructs the necessary elements for the interface itself.  However, in order to function properly, the HTML of the table itself, must be properly formatted and nested.  Also, tables that have cells with either the <code>colspan</code> or <code>rowspan</code> attributes will not function properly.
</p>


<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Once you have included the <strong>tabletrim.js</strong> and <strong>tabletrim.css</strong> files in your page, 
you can initialize the plugin by calling the <code>tabletrim()</code> function. The <code>tabletrim()</code>
function takes two parameters:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>obj</strong> (required):<br />
        jQuery object(s) that you want the plugin to manipulate
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>options</strong> (optional)<br />
        Options object.  For details about available options, see the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}tabletrim/options">Options page</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
While not a traditional jQuery plugin, <strong>tabletrim</strong> does rely on jQuery, so make sure you're calling
the <code>tabletrim()</code> function within your <code>$(document).ready()</code> block.
</p>

<div class="code-wrapper">
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// Sample JS
$(document).ready(function() {
    // Select object
    var obj = $('#my-table');
    var opts = { label: false }
	tabletrim(obj, opts);
});
{% endhighlight %}
</div>




<h3>Return value</h3>
<p>
Calling <code>tabletrim()</code> returns an <strong>object</strong> which can be used to access
the public methods (see Public Methods below).
</p>



<h2>AMD Compliant</h2>
<p>
<strong>tabletrim.js</strong> is AMD compliant, which means that it can be used out of the box as an AMD module for scripts like <strong>require.js</strong>. If you're using <strong>require.js</strong> you can simply load the module like you would any other module:
</p>
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
require(['tabletrim'], function(tabletrim) {
    var mytabletrim = tabletrim($('#my-table'));
});
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
If you're not using <strong>require.js</strong> or some other AMD-backed script loader, don't worry.  The plugin still exposes a global function <code>tabletrim()</code> that you can use to initialize <strong>tabletrim</strong>.  In fact, all of the code samples in this documentation use that method. Just make sure you're manually including jQuery and calling <code>tabletrim()</code> within the <code>document.ready</code> block.
</p> 



<h2>CSS and styling</h2>
<p>
<strong>tabletrim</strong> dynamically adds CSS classes to various elements as part of the initialization process.  These classes are necessary for the core functionality of the plugin.  The core styles are defined in the included CSS file, <strong>tabletrim.css</strong>. Because the styles are defined in CSS, you can modify them however you want in order to create a custom look and feel for the tables.  However, proceed with caution when editing the CSS as mistakes could lead to breaking the plugin's functionality.
</p>



<h2>Public methods</h2>
<p>
<strong>tabletrim</strong> exposes public methods which are returned as an object to the <code>tabletrim()</code> function call.
To utilize the public methods, simply capture the return in a variable and call the public methods as methods of that variable.
