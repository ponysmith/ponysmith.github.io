<p>
<strong>imgin.js</strong> is a javascript plugin for lazy-loading images.  The plugin is extremely lightweight (1Kb minified) and is focused on performance and providing useful functionality beyond simple lazy loading.
</p>


<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<strong>updown.js</strong> requires jQuery 1.7+ to run.</p>



<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
While not a traditional jQuery plugin, <storng>imgin</strong> does rely on jQuery, so make sure you're calling
the <code>imgin()</code> function within your <code>$(document).ready()</code> block.
</p>

<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>
To work properly, <strong>imgin</strong> requires that you add an attribute to your <code>img</code> tags in your HTML.
By default, this attribute is <code>data-imginsrc</code>, but can be changed via the options object when <strong>imgin</strong>
is initialized.  This attribute must exist on any image you want <strong>imgin</strong> to lazy load and the value of the
attribute should be the path to the image (just as you would write it in a normal image <code>src</code> attribute). 
</p>
<div class="msg-info">
    <div class="msgcontent">
        There are two important things to note about the HTML:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Your image tags should <strong>NOT</strong> include a normal <code>src</code> attribute.  The <code>src</code>
                attribute will be created by <strong>imgin</strong> dynamically.  Adding a <code>src</code> attribute is
                redundant and can impact performance since <code>src</code> attributes (even empty ones) trigger an HTTP request.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your images should be manually assigned width and height (either in the <code>img</code> tag or via CSS). 
                Without dimensions, the images will take up no space on the page until they load, meaning you'll get a lot
                of content jumping around as various images load.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</div>



<h3>Javascript</h3>
<p>
Once you have your HTML set up and have included the <strong>imgin</strong> JS file in your page, 
you can initialize the plugin by calling the <code>imgin()</code> function.
The function takes an optional options object as its single argument.  See below for more information on the options object.
</p>

<div class="code-wrapper">
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// Sample JS
var opts = {
    // Set options here
}
imgin(opts);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>



<h3>CSS</h3>
<p>
    There is no CSS required for <strong>imgin</strong> to run.  However, adding CSS styles can make the experience
    much smoother.  For example, using CSS transitions to fade the loaded images in can be a nice touch.
</p>
<div class="code-wrapper">
{% highlight css linenos %}
/* Unloaded images */
img[data-imginloaded="false"] { 
    opacity: 0; 
}
/* Loaded images */
img[data-imginloaded="true"] { 
    opacity: 1; 
    transition: opacity 1s; 
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>


<h3>Data attributes</h3>
<p>
    Upon initialization, all lazy-loadable images are given an attribute <code>data-imginloaded</code>.  Initially,
    this attribute is set to <code>false</code>.  When an image is loaded, the attribute is changed to <code>true</code>.
    This attribute makes for an easy way to target images via CSS or jQuery.
</p>


<h3>Return value</h3>
<p>
    Calling <code>imgin()</code> returns an <strong>object</strong> which includes the public methods (see below).
</p>





<h2>The options object</h2>
<p>
The options object can set any of the following properties:
</p>

<table summary="Options object properties">
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th width="50" scope="col">Property</th>
        <th width="100" scope="col">Default</th>
        <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>offset</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>
        	The offset in pixels outside the viewport (or inside with negative number) at which to begin lazy loading an image.
        	E.g. a value of 100 would trigger loading on images once they got within 100px of the viewport.  
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>lag</td>
        <td>200</td>
        <td>
        	The delay (in milliseconds) to wait after the scroll event finishes before triggering a load cycle.
        	If you find you are having performance problems (due to <strong>lots</strong> of images for example), 
        	you can increase this number to improve performance.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>attr</td>
        <td>data-imginsrc</td>
        <td>
        	The attribute on the image tag that will mark the image as lazy-loadable and will store the image path.
        	Unless you have a good reason to change this, it is suggested that you leave the default.  Note that,
        	for performance reasons, once an image is loaded, this attribute is removed and that image is removed 
        	and <strong>imgin</strong> no longer recognizes that image as lazy-loadable.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>onload</td>
        <td>null</td>
        <td>
        	<p>
        	Callback function fired for each image when it finishes loading.  The function passes a jQuery reference
        	to the loaded image as its single parameter.
        	</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>



<h2>Public methods</h2>

<p>
<strong>imgin</strong> exposes public methods which are returned as an object to the <code>imgin()</code> function call.
To utilize the public methods, simply capture the return in a variable and call the public methods as methods of that variable.
</p>

<div class="code-wrapper">
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// Example of calling a public method
$(document).ready(function() {
    var myImgs = imgin();
    myImgs.force();
});
{% endhighlight %}
</div>


<h3>.refresh()</h3>
<p>
	The <code>refresh()</code> method refreshes the array of lazy-loadable images that <strong>imgin</strong> stores
	internally.  This is useful if you are dynamically adding more lazy-loadable images to the DOM.  Calling
	<code>refresh()</code> will ensure that <strong>imgin</strong> is aware of these images.
</p>


<h3>.force()</h3>
<p>
	The <code>force()</code> method forces all lazy-loadable images that have not been loaded to load immediately rather
	than waiting for them to enter the viewport.  This only affects images that are currently recognized as lazy-loadable
	by <strong>imgin</strong>.  If you want to add new images to the DOM and force load them, make sure you call
	<code>refresh()</code> first.
