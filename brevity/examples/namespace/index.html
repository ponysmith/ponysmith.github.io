<p>
Namespacing in brevity.js allows you to register multiple abbreviations with the 
same abbreviation text.  This can come in handy on the off chance you have
two identical abbreviations that have different meanings.
</p>

<p>  
Namespaces in brevity.js work by using a colon (<code>:</code>) to add a namespace before the actual abbreviation.  
When brevity.js parses the abbreviation, everything to the left of the final colon will be considered a namespace and will
be used for disambiguation purposes only.  Everything to the right of the final colon is what will be printed out by brevity.js
as the text for that <code>abbr</code> tag.
</p>
<p>
For example, let's say you were using the abbrevation WWF for two purposes:
</p>
<ol>
<li>World Wrestling Federation</li>
<li>World Wildlife Fund</li>
</ol>
<p>
In this case, you could namespace these abbrevations in the abbrevations array of your JS like so:
</p>

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var abbrs = [
    { abbr: 'Pandas:WWF', title: 'World Wildlife Fund' },
    { abbr: 'HulkHogan:WWF', title: 'World Wrestling Federation' }
];
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
Then, in your HTML, you would simply type out the appropriate abbreviation (with namespace) and brevity.js will correctly
convert it.  Check out the sample code below to see it in action.
</p>



<h2>Code</h2>

<h3>Sample HTML</h3>
<div class="code-wrapper">
{% highlight html %}
<!-- sample HTML -->
<p>Due to his love of pandas, Hulk Hogan (of HulkHogan:WWF fame) held a fundraiser for the Pandas:WWF.</p>
{% endhighlight %}
</div>


<h3>Sample Javascript</h3>
<div class="code-wrapper">
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// sample JS
var abbrs = [
    { abbr: 'Pandas:WWF', title: 'World Wildlife Fund' },
    { abbr: 'HulkHogan:WWF', title: 'World Wrestling Federation' }
];
brevity(abbrs);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>


<h2>Result</h2>
<!-- sample HTML -->
<div id="abbr-result" class="msg-info">
    <div class="msgcontent">
    Due to his love of pandas, Hulk Hogan (of HulkHogan:WWF fame) held a fundraiser for the Pandas:WWF.
    </div>
</div>


<h2>Another use for namespacing</h2>

<p>
Another potential use for the namespacing capabilities of brevity.js is to have more control over when 
abbreviations get parsed.  For example, let's say you want brevity.js to handle the term HTML, but you
only want it to be abbreviated the first time it appears on the page.  You might be able to use the
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}brevity/examples/rootnode">root node option</a> to accomplish this.  But you could also use namespacing. All
you would need to do is add a namespace (for example, <code>convert</code>).  Then,
any time you want brevity to handle the abbreviation, you would type <code>convert:HTML</code> and anytime
you want the text to appear unchanged, you would simply type <code>HTML</code>.  Easy peesy.

<script>
var brevity_example = 'namespace';
function brevity_namespace() {
    // brevity namespace example
    var abbrs = [
        { abbr: 'Pandas:WWF', title: 'World Wildlife Fund' },
        { abbr: 'HulkHogan:WWF', title: 'World Wrestling Federation' }
    ];
    // I know, I know ... this doesn't match the JS in the example code above
    // I'm adding the root option here so that only the result html is converted
    // Otherwise, all the abbreviations in the sample code would be converted as well, and that would just be weird
    var opts = { 'root': document.getElementById('abbr-result') };
    brevity(abbrs, opts);
}
</script>
