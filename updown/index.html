<p>
    <strong>updown.js</strong> is a small JS utility script that publishes custom events at defined breakpoints. The
    goal is to allow your Javascript to bind and unbind events or take specific actions at breakpoints, thus making
    your Javascript just as responsive as your CSS can be with media queries.
</p>
<p> 
    <strong>updown.js</strong> fires a custom event any time the window is resized and passes one of the predefined (or user-defined) breakpoints.  Custom <strong>updown</strong> events use the breakpoint size for their name and are namespaced with <code>up</code> or <code>down</code> depending on the direction of the resize.  For example, resizing the window from 1000 pixels wide to 1100 pixels wide would pass the 1024 breakpoint, firing the <code>1024</code> event.  Since the window size has increased, the <code>up</code> namespace is used, meaning the fired event is <code>1024.up</code>.
</p>



<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<strong>updown.js</strong> requires jQuery 1.7+ to run.</p>



<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>
Once the library has been included, you can instantiate <strong>updown</strong> by calling the <code>updown()</code> 
function in jQuery's <code>document.ready</code>.  
</p>


<div class="code-wrapper">
{%highlight javascript linenos %}
$(document).ready(function() {
    updown();
});
{% endhighlight %}
</div>


<p>
Once the library has been instantiated, you can bind your javascript to the custom events (events are fired on the window object):
</p>

<div class="code-wrapper">
{%highlight javascript linenos %}
$(window).on('1024.up', function() { 
    // This code will execute when the window width increases and passes 1024 pixels
});
$(window).on('768.down', function() { 
    // This code will execute when the window width decreases and passes 768 pixels
});
{% endhighlight %}
</div>


<h3>Return value</h3>
Calling <code>updown()</code> returns an <strong>array</strong> of the registered breakpoints.  This can be helpful in knowing
what breakpoints are available if you've registered additional breakpoints.




<h2>Options</h2>

<p>
The <code>updown()</code> function takes an options object as its single (optional) parameter.  Any of the following 
options can be set using the options parameter.

<table class="tabletrim" summary="Object properties for the updown.js constructor function parameter">
<thead>
<tr>
    <th scope="col" width="30">Parameter</th>
    <th scope="col" width="30">Type</th>
    <th scope="col" width="30">Default</th>
    <th scope="col">Description</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
    <td>lag</td>
    <td>int</td>
    <td>100</td>
    <td>
        Time in milliseconds to wait after a resize event finishes before checking for passed breakpoints.  
        The default of 100 should be fine in most cases.  Setting the number higher will improve performance 
        but will create small delay before events are fired.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>breakpoints</td>
    <td>array</td>
    <td>[320, 480, 768, 1024, 1280]</td>
    <td>
        Array of breakpoints to publish events for.  Any breakpoints passed in this parameter will be added 
        to (not overwrite) the default
    </td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<h3>Example using options object</h3>
<div class="code-wrapper">
{%highlight javascript %}
$(document).ready(function() {
    var opts = {
        lag: 200,
        breakpoints: [640]
    }
    updown(opts);
});
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
