<p>
<strong>shyft.js</strong> is a jQuery/Javascript content carousel plugin with a focus on being lightweight, feature-rich and 
highly customizable.  To that end, <strong>shyft.js</strong> is small (~5kb minified), versatile (AMD-compliant for use with <strong>require.js</strong>),
and very customizable with a host of options, callbacks and exposed public methods.
</p>


<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<strong>shyft.js</strong> requires jQuery 1.7+ to run.</p>


<h2>HTML structure</h2>
<p>
	While very versatile, <strong>shyft</strong> does expect a specific HTML structure.  When initializing the plugin, you will need to pass
	a jQuery selected object in as a parameter.  This object should be the direct parent element of the elements you would like <strong>shyft</strong>
	to convert into slides.  Remember, any direct child elements of this wrapping element will be converted to slides, so if you want to add additional
	HTML (for example to create a custom navigation system for your carousel), you need to place it outside the wrapping element.  For an example, consider
	the following HTML:
</p>
{% highlight html linenow %}
<!--
Here, div#shyft-wrapper is the wrapping element we will pass into the initialization function
The child elements (div.shyft-item) will be converted into slides.
Note the id and classes are not required and are there just for reference
-->
<div id="shyft-wrapper">
	<div class="shyft-item"></div>
	<div class="shyft-item"></div>
	<div class="shyft-item"></div>
	<div class="shyft-item"></div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}


<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Once you have included the <strong>shyft.js</strong> file in your page, 
you can initialize the plugin by calling the <code>shyft()</code> function. The <code>shyft()</code>
function takes two parameters:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>obj</strong> (required):<br />
        jQuery object(s) that you want the plugin to manipulate
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>options</strong> (optional)<br />
        Options object.  For details about available options, see the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}shyft/options">Options page</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
While not a traditional jQuery plugin, <strong>shyft</strong> does rely on jQuery, so make sure you're calling
the <code>shyft()</code> function within your <code>$(document).ready()</code> block.
</p>

<div class="code-wrapper">
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// Sample JS
$(document).ready(function() {
    // Select object
    var obj = $('#my-object');
    var opts = {
        autoplay: false
    }
	shyft(obj, opts);
});
{% endhighlight %}
</div>




<h3>Return value</h3>
<p>
Calling <code>shyft()</code> returns an <strong>object</strong> which can be used to access
the public methods (see Public Methods below).
</p>



<h2>AMD Compliant</h2>
<p>
<strong>shyft.js</strong> is AMD compliant, which means that it can be used out of the box as an AMD module for scripts like <strong>require.js</strong>.
If you're using <strong>require.js</strong> you can simply load the module like you would any other module:
</p>
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
require(['shyft'], function(shyft) {
var myshyft = shyft($('#myshyft'));
});
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
If you're not using <strong>require.js</strong> or some other AMD-backed script loader, don't worry.  The plugin still exposes a global 
function <code>shyft()</code> that you can use to initialize your carousels.  In fact, all of the code samples in this documentation use that method. 
Just make sure you're manually including jQuery and calling <code>shyft()</code> within the <code>document.ready</code> block.
</p> 


<h2>Responsive</h2>
<p>
<strong>shyft</strong> has responsiveness baked in to the plugin itself.  When the window resizes, <strong>shyft</strong> will automatically
adjust the width of the carousel items and animations to make sure they stay in sync.  All you have to do is make sure that the wrapper 
element is responsive in your CSS (using media queries or a max-width).  <strong>shyft</strong> takes care of the rest!
</p>
<p>
If you want some additional control of the responsiveness, <strong>shyft</strong> also has a public method <code>update()</code> that
you can use to update the carousel with a fresh set of options.  Then all you need to do is call <code>update()</code>
anytime you pass a breakpoint and need to change the carousel.  Now, if only there was a way to expose breakpoints in Javascript &hellip;

</p>



<h2>CSS and styling</h2>
<p>
<strong>shyft</strong> dynamically adds CSS classes to various elements as part of the initialization process.  These classes are used to 
add necessary styles to the carousel, slides, links, etc.  The core styles are defined in the included CSS file, <strong>shyft.css</strong>.
Because the styles are defined in CSS, you can modify them however you want in order to create a custom look and feel for your carousel.  Just make sure
you don't mess around with the core styles (core styles are clearly noted in the CSS).  Altering core styles could affect the functionality 
of the carousel.
</p>


<h2>Public methods</h2>

<p>
<strong>shyft</strong> exposes public methods which are returned as an object to the <code>shyft()</code> function call.
To utilize the public methods, simply capture the return in a variable and call the public methods as methods of that variable.
