<h2>Autoplay Statuses</h2>
<p>
    Slideshow status in <strong>shyft</strong> has one of four values: 
</p>

<h3>start</h3>
<p>
The <strong>start</strong> status is a temporary status that occurs when the slideshow is being started.  Once the slideshow is started, the status
will automatically switch to <strong>play</strong>.  This status is necessary so that a slideshow can be (re)started from the <strong>stop</strong> status.
</p>

<h3>stop</h3>
<p>
The <strong>stop</strong> status means that the slideshow has been completely stopped (not just paused).  
</p>

<h3>play</h3>
<p>
The <strong>play</strong> status means that the slideshow is currently playing.
</p>

<h3>pause</h3>
<p>
The <strong>pause</strong> status means that the slideshow has been temporarily paused (but not stopped).
